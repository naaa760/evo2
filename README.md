## üß¨ EVO2: DNA Variant Analysis Platform

<br/>

EVO2 is a sleek, intuitive web app that turns tiny DNA tweaks into powerful insights. Just search your gene, let our AI predict if a variant is harmful or harmless, and instantly see how it compares to real-world cases. In minutes, EVO2 makes the mysteries of your genome crystal clear‚Äîso researchers and clinicians can focus on what matters most: better health.

- I have created a demo video for this project because it uses Modal AI, which offers only a 30-day free tier. Since the free access expires quickly because of calling the API to fetch the data, I recorded the video to show how the project works. You can still run the project locally on your machine by following the provided instructions.
EVO2 is an advanced AI-powered platform for predicting the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants in DNA. It helps researchers and healthcare professionals determine whether tiny changes in a person's genetic code are likely to cause diseases.
